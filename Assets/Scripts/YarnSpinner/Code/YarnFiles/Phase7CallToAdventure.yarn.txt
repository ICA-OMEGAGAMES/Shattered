    Devon: I’ll go with you, I need to know who killed her.
    Malphas (in Devon’s thoughts): By the way, my name is Malphas. A pleasure to make my introductions. 
    Devon (thought): Great it even has a name.

    Devon: Maybe I don't want answers? I’ve tried looking for answers. I’ve done everything I can. And nothing will bring her back.
