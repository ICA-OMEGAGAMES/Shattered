    //Devon wakes up after the fight. 

<<setsprite FaceImage devon>>
    Devon (thought): Groans, my head hurts.
    //Devon sees the bodies from the gang members lying around.
    Devon (thought): What...what happened here?
    Devon (thought): Where am I?
    Devon (thought): I thought that it was finally over… 
    //(Does he want to kill himself? Is he that depressed?)
    //He hears a voice inside his head.
<<setsprite FaceImage malphas>>
    Malphas (in Devon’s thoughts): Well, you’re welcome.
<<setsprite FaceImage devon>>
    Devon (thought): What the hell...I’m starting to hear things.
<<setsprite FaceImage malphas>>
    Malphas (in Devon’s thoughts): Is that all I get for saving your life?
<<setsprite FaceImage devon>>
    Devon (thought): Who the hell are you? Why are you in my head?
<<setsprite FaceImage malphas>>
    Malphas (in Devon’s thoughts): I’m Malphas, I’m here to help you.
<<setsprite FaceImage devon>>
    Devon (thought): Great it even has a name. I must be going crazy.
    Devon (thought): Probably still drunk, it’ll go away soon.
    //Malphas appears in front of Devon.
    Devon: Oh now I’m seeing things, no fucking way you’re real, you’re not real.
<<setsprite FaceImage malphas>>
    Malphas: Oh I’m real, and like I said before, I’m here to help you.
<<setsprite FaceImage devon>>
    Devon: Help with what?
<<setsprite FaceImage malphas>>
    Malphas: Getting answers. 
<<setsprite FaceImage devon>>
    Devon: Why would I want that?
<<setsprite FaceImage malphas>>
    Malphas: You want answers about Joy but you cant even beat some random gang members.
    Malphas: How do you expect to get answers without my help… Without me you would be dead right now.
