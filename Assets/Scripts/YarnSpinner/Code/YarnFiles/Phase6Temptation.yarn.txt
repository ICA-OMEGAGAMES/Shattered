//Devon wakes up after the fight. 

Devon (thought): Groans, my head hurts.

    //Devon sees the bodies from the gang members lying around.

Devon (thought): What...what happened here?
Devon (thought): Where am I?
Devon (thought): I thought that it was finally over… //(Does he want to kill himself? Is he that depressed?)
//He hears a voice inside his head.
Malphas (in Devon’s thoughts): Well, you’re welcome.
Devon (thought): What the hell...I’m starting to hear things.
Malphas (in Devon’s thoughts): Is that all I get for saving your life?
Devon (thought): Who the hell are you? Why are you in my head?
Malphas (in Devon’s thoughts): I’m Malphas, I’m here to help you.
Devon (thought): Great it even has a name. I must be going crazy.
Devon (thought): Probably still drunk, it’ll go away soon.
            //Malphas appears in front of Devon.
Devon: Oh now I’m seeing things, no fucking way you’re real, you’re not real.
Malphas: Oh I’m real, and like I said before, I’m here to help you.
Devon: Help with what?
Malphas: Getting answers. 
Devon: Why would I want that?
Malphas: You want answers about Joy but you cant even beat some random gang members.
Malphas: How do you expect to get answers without my help… Without me you would be dead right now.
