//Devon goes outside to buy any alcoholic drink that is available at his local pub. When he is outside he hears the noises of a fight going on. Two gang members are beating up a homeless man.

Homeless victim (begging): Someone help, please, you, please help!
Gang member: Shut up, filth.
Gang member: You deserve this, you piece of shit.

Devon (thought):Just walk away. Not my problem.
Devon starts to walk away from the fight.
Gang member: Hey you!
Devon turns to see the gang members charging at him.
Devon: (sigh) Shit.
